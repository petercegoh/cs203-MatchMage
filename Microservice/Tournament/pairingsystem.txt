Pre tournament 

assign number of rounds based on number of participants

Tournament algo

Rd 1

Randomly map 1 number to each participating player
pair each player to the player mapped with the number that would add up to the total number of players + 1

Rd 2-n onwards

Match results points are determined by the following

W - 3 pt
UID - 1 pt
ID - 1 pt
L - 0 pt

Game result points are determined by the following

GW - 3 pt
GL - 0 pt

Byes are considered Match wins and 2 GWs, but are ignored when calculating OGW & OMW


Calculate each player's score
---------
MW % 
---------
total number of match points / rounds played

if MW% < 0.33, MW = 0.33
----------
GW %
----------

Total number of game points (match points)  / games played

if GW% < 0.33, GW = 0.33

--------------
Opp MW%
--------------
summation of Opp MW% / Opps faced


--------------
Opp GW%
--------------

summation Opp GW% / Opps faced

-------------------------------

Ranking will then be determined by following priority

1 Match points
2 Opp MW%
3 GW%
4 Opp GW%

After ranking, If total odd number, assign bye randomly among those with lowest scores

starting at the bottom bracket ( players with lowest scores )

1. if there are an odd number of players within the bracket, randomly select a player to be up paired to the next point bracket

2. go to the next bracket randomly select and remove a player from that bracket to pair with the previous player to be uppaired
2.5 if both players have played against each other, randomly pick another player from that bracket to replace

3. if even number of players remaining in the bracket, move onto the next bracket and start at 1., else start at 1. at this bracket
